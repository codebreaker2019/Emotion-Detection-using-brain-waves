# Emotion Detection using brain waves
 This work proposes a robust end-to-end emotion recognition system using 1D-CNN from brain waves. To begin with, we decompose raw EEG signals into six sub-bands and extract the power spectrum feature by utilizing the fast Fourier transform technique. After that, we combined extracted power spectrum features with eye movement and removed differential entropy features. We do experiment with SJTU Emotion EEG Dataset SEED-V. This dataset is publicly available on their official website: https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/home/seed/
